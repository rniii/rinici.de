title: Playable 88x31s
subtitle: Little games smaller than gifs
---

Recently I worked on a [1kb Tetris game][tetris], and I figured it'd be fun to embed little games
inside 88x31s. Here they are! Each fit in under 700 bytes, so you aren't bloating your website
any more than adding a normal button.

- [Snake](#snake)
- [Flappy bird](#flappy)
- [Bouncy DVD logo](#dvd)
- [Sand toy](#sand)

## Flappy bird {#flappy}

Initially was just going to be black and white rectangles, but I was able to have a little fun
making the graphics for it since it turned out to not be a whole lot of code.

## Bouncy DVD logo {#dvd}

Will you catch it hitting the corner? Despite the looks I'm not a maths nerd, so I have no idea if
it is actually possible for each random coordinate. Good luck!
