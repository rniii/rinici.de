title: Color palette

This website uses the theme I made for my editor, the colors are bright and not too saturated,
giving it good contrast when used for text:

<pre>
- <span style="color:#ee9598">Error!</span>       #ee9598
- <span style="color:#e8d097">Types</span>        #e8d097
- <span style="color:#9be099">Strings</span>      #9be099
- <span style="color:#97d0e8">Operators</span>    #97d0e8
- <span style="color:#979ae8">Functions</span>    #979ae8
- <span style="color:#ca97e8">Keywords</span>     #ca97e8

- <span style="color:#d895ee">Primary</span>      #d895ee
- <span style="color:#ee95d2">Secondary</span>    #ee95d2
- <span style="color:#d8d0d5">Text</span>         #d8d5d0
- <span style="color:#909090">Punctuation</span>  #909090
</pre>

You can [find my system files here](https://github.com/rniii/dots/), although it's nothing fancy. I
simply got catppuccin's plugin and replaced all its colors so I don't have to bother with support.
